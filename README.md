## Project Euler: My Solutions using JavaScript

## About

### What is Project Euler?

Taken from ProjectEuler.net, "Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems."[<sup>1</sup>](#ref1)

### Where can I find more information about the problems?

The problems are described on the Project Euler website, in the *Archives* section.[<sup>2</sup>](#ref2) As of today, (21 Sep 2023), there are 845 problems on their website.

### Why use JavaScript?

I discovered the Euler Project through freeCodeCamp, where the problems are introduced through JavaScript.[<sup>3</sup>](#ref3) However, there is no reason why the problems could not be attempted in other programming languages.
